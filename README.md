# Automatic Distance Alarm System
- Uses the **ESPRESSIF ESP32S2 microcontroller**, code written in **Arduino IDE** in **C++**
- Computes distance from an **ultrasonic distance sensor** and speed of socund algorithm
- Activates **alarm** function if distance < threshold, or **button** is held down
- Alarm is **alternating flashing lights** plus a **loud buzzer**
- Buzzer can be silenced through **website** hosted on its **wireless access point**
- Distance and more feedback info is available in the **serial monitor** (terminal-like window) of the Arduino IDE
- Distance & more feedback _also_ now available on the **4-digit display**
