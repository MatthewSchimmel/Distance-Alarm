# Final Project - Automatic & Manual Distance Alarm System
- Uses the **ESP32S2 microcontroller**, code written in **Arduino IDE** in **C++**
- Computes distance from an **ultrasonic distance sensor** and speed of socund algorithm
- Strip of LED's indicates level of closeness to threshold
- Activates **alarm** function if distance < threshold, or **button** is held down
- Alarm is **flashing lights** plus a **loud buzzer**
- Buzzer can be silenced through **website** hosted on its **wireless access point**
- Distance and more feedback info is available in the **serial monitor** (terminal-like window) of the Arduino IDE
- Distance and more feedback info is also now available on an LCD screen

## Canvas Assignment Specifications:
### Final Project
Pick a problem or need and use Design Thinking to propose, develop and prototype an embedded design to solve that problem using a Raspberry Pi Pico or an ESP32 and using the techniques we have covered. Combining multiple processors is fine and may garner extra credit, but both must be running code you have written.
Required elements:
It must exhibit interaction by:
- Using at least three unique inputs (including the internet or console/serial)
- Using at least three unique outputs (including the internet or console/serial)

Note: multiple buttons only count as one input and multiple LEDs only count as one output

You must turn in your design on Canvas by December 7. You will also give a 5-10 minute presentation and demonstration of your design during class on December 5 or December 7.

This will **not** be a team project
___
### Project Presentation
As before, you must make a presentation to the class in addition to submitting documentation to Canvas

Your presentation must consist of the following elements:
- Statement of problem
- Discussion of design process, especially how it ties into Design Thinking
- Design result
- Demonstration
- Discussion of challenges and conquests
___
### Project Submission (Documentation)
- Statement of problem, overall description of design, and design process used (pdf)
- A photograph of your completed project (png or jpg)
- Schematics (pdf)
- Code listing (text or pdf)
May be zipped together, or placed in a single PDF
